# SIOT-Jacket

This repository contains code to drive a smart cycling jacket with embedded light sensor, accelerometers, and NeoPixel LED strips (and vibe motor discs!) The aim is to illuminate cyclists automatically under dark conditions and activate lights on the arms when cyclists signal turns with traditional arm signal moves.
